MIT’s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?,The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.,"When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket’s maximum lifetime.","When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket’s expiration time to the server’s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.","When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC’s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",C

"In Brumley and Boneh’s paper on side-channel attacks, why does blinding prevent the timing attack from working?","Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.","Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server’s true p and q values.","Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary’s input and the timing differences.","Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.",C

"Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don’t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?

You are given a message (m) and its OTP encryption (c). Can you compute the OTP key from m and c ?,"No, I cannot compute the key.","Yes, the key is k = m xor c.",I can only compute half the bits of the key.,"Yes, the key is k = m xor m.",B
