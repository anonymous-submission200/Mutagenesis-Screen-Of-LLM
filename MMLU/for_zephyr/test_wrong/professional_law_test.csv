"A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order","valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.","valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.","invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.","invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",B

"A man who was separated but never divorced from his first wife, married another woman and lived with her as husband and wife. The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime.

In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated.

"For many years, persons engaged in real estate transactions in a state have utilized installment land contracts. The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as ""liquidated"" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?","Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.","Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.","No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.","No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.",A

"A police officer was employed on a city's police force for 10 years.

After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:""The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. ""The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, ""I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. ""In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will","win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.","win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.","lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.","lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.",C

"The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale.

"During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin.

"An environmentalist was very interested in environmental issues, particularly protection of wetland areas. He decided to dig out the lawn in his back yard and turn the space into a swampy marsh. Eventually, his back yard was filled with tall grasses, reeds, and other marsh plants. A wide variety of frogs, turtles, snakes, birds, and other animals inhabited the yard. The ground was usually covered by several inches of standing water. The environmentalist's neighbors were not pleased with the condition of the environmentalist's yard. They complained that it produced foul odors, and they claimed that the standing water was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects. Several months after the environmentalist converted his yard into a marsh, a real estate investor purchased the house closest to the environmentalist's back yard swamp. The investor lived in a large city several hundred miles away, and he purchased the house next to the environmentalist's for investment purposes. The investor rented the house to a family under a long-term lease. The tenant family complained frequently to the investor about being annoyed by the environmentalist's yard. If the investor asserts a nuisance claim against the environmentalist, the environmentalist's best defense would be",that he had sound environmental reasons for maintaining the swampy condition of his yard.,that turning his yard into a swampy marsh did not violate any zoning ordinance.,"that the investor owns the property but has rented it out, so the investor does not have actual possession or the right to immediate possession of the land.","that when the investor purchased the house, he knew or should have known about the swampy condition of the environmentalist's property.",C

"In a secluded county, where prejudice festers and discrimination flourishes, there is a lovely lake, which the county has developed and maintained for recreational purposes. Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around.

"To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance.

"A circus operates in a rural part of the county. It is the circus's practice to finish each day's entertainment by discharging a so-called aerial bomb into the sky. After exploding, the aerial bomb emits a spectacular rainbow fireworks display that is seen for miles around. One afternoon, a 10-year-old boy and a few friends went to the fairgrounds to see the circus. After paying their admission, they were about to enter the ""big top"" when the boy came upon an aerial bomb lying on the ground. Ignorant of what the object really was, but in an exploratory mood, the boy applied a match to the fuse of the fireworks device. It exploded and seriously injured the boy. After the accident, and before the parents of the boy had retained a lawyer, the adjuster for the circus's insurance carrier contacted the parents several times, trying to negotiate a settlement of their claim against the circus. On each occasion, the adjuster told the parents there was no need for them to hire an attorney because the applicable civil code did not provide for recovery in such a situation. The adjuster was aware that this information was blatantly false. He also warned the parents that unless they accepted his offered settlement of $5,000, they would receive nothing. For over a month, the adjuster continued to harass the parents. Outraged by the adjuster's actions, the parents sought the advice of a neighbor who recommended that they consult an attorney. The parents went ahead and retained a lawyer who subsequently negotiated a $250,000 settlement with the adjuster's insurance company for the claims relating to the boy's injury from the aerial bomb.

"A college student initiated a criminal case against his former roommate, claiming the former roommate snuck in and removed his state-of-the-art home theater equipment from his house. The college student took the complaint papers that were approved by the prosecution and filed them with a magistrate court. An ongoing police investigation later determined, however, that the college student was a vengeful person not averse to creating stories, and that he and the former roommate had been arguing over several related issues. They also determined that he never had any quality sound or video equipment. The police dropped the prosecution, and the criminal case was dismissed at the preliminary hearing.

"Within the last two years, the number of cases coming before the U. S. Supreme Court has quadrupled. Because of this increased work load, the Court has complained that it is unable to properly review all of its cases. As a consequence, Congress formed a committee to conduct a study on improving the functioning and operation of the Court. Based on the committee's recommendations, Congress enacted a statute dividing the Court into two panels. One panel would be assigned to handle criminal cases exclusively, while the other panel would handle all non-criminal matters. Each panel would be composed of four associate justices and a chief justice. According to the new law, the decisions of each panel would be final and not reviewable by any other court or judiciary. Which of the following is the strongest argument against the constitutionality of this federal statute?",The statute contravenes the requirement in the Constitution that there be one Supreme Court.,The statute does not fall within the enumerated powers of Congress and is not necessary and proper for the effectuation of those powers.,"Based on the doctrine ofjudicial supremacy, Congress does not have authority to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.","Based on the separate sovereignty doctrine, Congress does not have authority to interfere with the procedural machinery of the Supreme Court.",A
"A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy.

"A repairman repaired damaged electrical power lines and replaced old, worn-out equipment whenever necessary for the local municipal electrical company. After a violent tornado had ripped through the city, the electrical company was busily trying to restore electrical power to its customers. The morning after the storm, the repairman was perched on a ladder trying to repair a high-voltage power line. As he was removing the cover of the transformer box, the ladder suddenly slipped on the wet ground, even though it had been properly fixed into position. The repairman struggled to maintain his balance and, luckily, the ladder came to rest against the transformer box. A pedestrian, who was walking on the street below, saw the repairman's predicament and began to climb the ladder to aid him. As the pedestrian was ascending the ladder, his foot slipped, and he fell to the ground.

The leader of this group of students was a first-year student from a neighboring state who established residency in the state after beginning classes. The group leader had been the recipient of a $5,000 annual grant from the state to finance his education. However, the aid was withdrawn because of a state statute, which provided: ""Any student attending a state university who engages in disruptive campus activities will not be eligible for state aid.

"A veterinarian was the owner in fee of a 50-acre tract of farmland. The veterinarian contracted to sell her property to an investor for $300,000. The parties signed a written land-sale agreement that provided for 30 monthly installment payments of $10,000 each. According to the terms of the sale agreement, the veterinarian would deliver a warranty deed to the investor upon payment of the last installment. In accordance with state law, the farmland's land-sale agreement was properly recorded. After making the first 10 installment payments, the investor discovered that there was an unrecorded mortgage on the farmland. The veterinarian, who is the mortgagor, has regularly made her mortgage payments and is not in default. This jurisdiction has the following recording statute in effect:""No conveyance or instrument is good as against any subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase. ""After the investor learned of the outstanding mortgage, he discontinued making further installment payments to the veterinarian. The investor alleged that the veterinarian was in breach of the land-sale agreement due to the existence of the unrecorded mortgage. The investor sues the veterinarian for breach of contract.

They were worried that the rugby club would be forced to disband because the law school had withdrawn its sponsorship. While the student was discussing the problem with his teammates, the owner of the tavern approached the players. The owner indicated that he was interested in sponsoring the rugby club because he felt it would help business at the pub. During their ensuing discussion, the owner agreed to sponsor the rugby club. The parties then orally agreed that the owner ""would pay for all the usual sponsoring fees"" incurred by the club. The owner had understood the agreement to mean that he would pay for the rugby shirts and supply the keg of beer following each ""home"" game that the rugby club played. Conversely, the student thought that the owner would be reimbursing the team for (a) the shirts, (b) the keg of beer (following ""home"" games), as well as (c) transportation expenses for ""away"" games and (d) equipment expenses (balls, etc. ).

The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created.

When the two men were mixing the colors but before they added it to the fish, an undercover FBI agent who worked on the premises and had recorded some of their discussions, arrested them for conspiracy and attempted criminal fraud. The accused filed a motion to dismiss the attempted fraud charge, arguing that they had not gone far enough for an attempt under the general principles of criminal attempt. Considering those principles, is the trial court likly to grant the motion to dismiss the attempt charge?","Yes, because the law of attempt requires more substantial action toward the completion of the crimes then the accused men accomplished under these facts.","Yes, because the fish would have to be delivered to the buyer and payment received from him for there to be a completed attempt.","No, because the act of purchasing the fish and taking it to seller's facility with the criminal intent to color it is sufficient proof of criminal attempt to allow the case to go to the jury.","No, because the agreement to commit criminal fraud by the two co-conspirators, combined with the act of mixing the colors, constituted sufficient proof of an attempt to commit the crime.",A

"A person owned property next to a highway. After raking leaves on his property into a large pile, the landowner loaded the leaves into several large metal barrels so that he could burn the leaves. Before starting the fire, the landowner telephoned the local weather bureau to determine which direction the wind would be blowing. Because a highway was located on the southern edge of his property, he was aware that it would be unsafe to burn the leaves if the wind was blowing in that direction. The weather bureau, however, indicated that the wind would be gusting in a northerly direction. Shortly after the landowner set the leaves on fire, the wind current unexpectedly shifted and started gusting in a southerly direction. As a consequence, the smoke and ashes blew over the highway, resulting in poor visibility. Moments later, a motorist was driving his automobile on the highway in a westerly direction. The posted speed limit was 45 m. p. h. , although the driver was traveling about 55 m. p. h. The driver could not see the highway clearly and crashed his vehicle into a median strip. If the driver asserts a claim against the landowner, the most likely result is","the landowner will prevail, because the driver was driving in excess of the speed limit.","the landowner will prevail, if his decision to burn the leaves was reasonable under the circumstances.","the driver will prevail, if the smoke from the burning leaves prevented him from clearly seeing the roadway.","the driver will prevail, because the landowner will be strictly liable for causing the accident.",B

Hill Street, which was located around the corner from the girl's home, was a popular sledding site because of its precipitous incline. The girl's parents had given her permission to sled down Hill Street. On the way to Hill Street, the girl met a classmate, who was 12, and asked if she wanted to join her.

The girl was sitting in front and controlling the steering mechanism while the classmate was behind her. They started their descent at a relatively good speed. As they were about halfway down the road, they approached the intersection of Hill Street and Maple Drive. A driver, who was driving his car along Maple Drive, entered the intersection at the same time as the girls on the sled. When the classmate saw the driver's auto cross into their path, she shouted to the girl to fall off the sled. The girl became frightened and refused to jump off. Just before the sled collided with the car, the classmate pushed the girl off the sled. Her push caused the girl to fall and break her leg.

"A rancher owned a 2,000-acre cattle ranch in a remote section of the state. For some time the rancher's cattle had been seized upon by roaming packs of wolves. In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device. One day, a cowboy was riding his horse along the outskirts of the rancher's property, when a gust of wind blew his hat onto the fence. The cowboy, who had undergone major heart surgery, wore a pacemaker.

As a result, Congress enacted a statute that limited recovery in personal injury actions filed in state court(s) to $400,000, and punitive action recovery to a maximum of $750,000. A man was injured in an automobile accident when a car driven by a woman drove through a red light and struck his vehicle. The man was paralyzed from the accident and became a paraplegic. The man brought a personal injury action against the woman in state court. The jury returned a verdict on the man's behalf and awarded him $1,000,000 in damages. After the jury verdict, the woman filed an appeal challenging the amount of the award, claiming that it was excessive and violated the federal guidelines set forth in the statute. The man has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The statute should be ruled","unconstitutional, because Congress cannot enact legislation involving local matters, such as automobile accidents, unless it involves interstate commerce.","unconstitutional, because a limitation on damage awards in tort actions would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states by operation of the Fifth Amendment.","constitutional, because under Article III, Congress has plenary power to regulate the jurisdiction and scope ofjudicial review of federal and lower state courts.","constitutional, because under the supremacy clause, when there is a conflict between federal law and state law, the federal law preempts and takes precedence over the conflicting state law.",A
"A womam owned a farm. She granted to a neighbor, the owner of an adjacent tract, an easement of way. The woman then went to Japan to live.

The woman returned and tried to evict the neighbor from the farm. The court held that the neighbor had acquired the farm by adverse possession. The neighbor then sold the farm back to the woman, who then put a chain across the easement. The neighbor has now brought an action to remove the chain. In most jurisdictions, the neighbor will","lose, because he abandoned his easement.","lose, because he did not use his easement for the statutory period of 20 years.","lose, because, rather than using his easement, he used all of the farm.","win, because mere non-use of an easement does not extinguish it.",C

"A woman had her kitchen renovated. She purchased a new dishwasher, and the contractor doing the renovations installed it in the woman's kitchen. Two months later, the woman was entertaining a friend at her home. As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. They saw sparks start flying out from underneath the dishwasher. The friend said, ""It must have a short circuit or something. Don't touch it or you might get electrocuted.

The contractor who installed the dishwasher failed to adequately ground the machine; if he had done so, the electric current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for proper grounding, but the contractor did not follow them.

"A state legislature has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state electionswho wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements.

"A surgeon operated on a patient in an operating room in the Marina General Hospital. The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will","prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.","prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur","not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.","not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.",A
"A farmer was the record title owner of a 30-acre tract of farmland. The farmer lived out of state and rarely visited the farmland, which remained unoccupied. Adjoining the farmland was a 50-acre ranch, which was owned by a rancher. In 2004, the rancher forged the farmer's signature on a deed and purported to convey the farmland to a grocer. The grocer paid the rancher $100,000 as the purchase price for the farmland. The following year, the grocer sold the property to a buyer for $125,000. The deed from the grocer to the buyer was properly executed and recorded by the buyer.

While doing so, he encountered the buyer, who informed the farmer that he was the new owner of the property. The farmer thereupon instituted suit to quiet title to the farmland.

"An owner of a large, three-story office building planned to renovate the building and requested several contractors to submit bids to perform the work. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project.

"A man wearing a jacket and jeans walked along a city street at night in a high crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. He saw two police officers walking toward him.

"On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions.

"A woman broke her leg while skiing. She was taken to a hospital where she was treated by a doctor who determined that the woman would need surgery to set the broken bones so that they would heal properly. During the surgery, the doctor inserted several metal screws into the woman's leg to hold the bones together. Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective.

When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be","granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money.","granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.",granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money.,denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.,B

"During a three-month period, a city was stunned by a series of mysterious deaths, which claimed the lives of 20 people. Although all the victims had apparently died from poisoning, the police were in a quandary as to who was responsible for the killings. There was finally a breakthrough in the investigation when a police toxicologist determined that all the victims had died after eating poisoned apples which had been purchased at a local market. The apples had all been contaminated with a pesticide. The police then received a letter from a person who claimed responsibility for the poisonings. The letter stated that the killings were in retaliation for the city's new policy of prosecuting toxic polluters. Acting upon an anonymous tip, the police arrested the owner of a pest control company engaged in the manufacture of pesticides, and charged him with 20 counts of murder. Thereafter, the city's largest newspaper ran a series of articles on the killings and referred to the owner as the pesticide poisoner. After the preliminary hearing, the state trial judge issued an exparte injunction against the newspaper prohibiting it from publishing any news during the trial that might be prejudicial to the owner. The newspaper appealed. In light of the U. S. Supreme Court cases to date, the state appellate court should","dissolve the injunction, because a news story about a matter of public interest is absolutely privileged.","dissolve the injunction, because it is an impermissible prior restraint on the freedom of the press.","uphold the injunction, because the inference of guilt in any prejudicial coverage would deny the defendant his constitutional right of a fair trial.","uphold the injunction, because reference to the defendant by the name pesticide poisoner would be inflammatory and prejudicial.",A
"A man borrowed $150,000 from a bank to remodel his home and executed a promissory note agreeing to repay the loan over a 10-year period. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action. While the action was pending, the mother learned of the bank's loan modification. The mother asserted that her mortgage had become a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage had become a second lien. Is the mother's assertion correct?","No, because the bank's loan modification was not detrimental to the rights of the mother.","No, because the man was not in default in his payments to his mother at the time of the bank's loan modification.","Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent.","Yes, because the bank's loan modification was material.",A

The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?","No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.","No, because the worker was an independent contractor.","Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.","Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.",A

"In 1973, a woman was the actual and record owner of 20 acres of certain undeveloped timberland. In September 1973, the woman mortgaged the 20 acres of timberland to the bank by a mortgage deed (in the traditional form of a conveyance in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent), which was not recorded until January 1974. The mortgage deed contained the following clause immediately after the legal description of the 20 acres of timberland:""Together with all the real property now owned by (the woman) or which shall be owned by (the woman) during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage. "" This mortgage was given, as the recorded instrument revealed, to secure a note for $100,000 repayable over a 40-year term. In March 2004, the woman, using money loaned by a finance company, purchased a 50-acre mountainous estate situated outside of a major city. This deed was recorded immediately. In April 2004, the woman executed and delivered to the finance company a mortgage to secure its loan. This mortgage was promptly and duly recorded. The finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank. In February 2007, the woman defaulted on both mortgages. The bank then initiated foreclosure proceedings against the woman and the finance company as joint defendants. In its foreclosure action, the bank averred that its mortgage was a first mortgage on both the 20 acres of timberland and the 50-acre estate. The finance company filed a cross-complaint, alleging that its mortgage was a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate and praying for foreclosure on that parcel of property. In order to decide this case in favor of the bank, the court does not need to resolve which of the following issues?",Whether the finance company is charged with record notice of the bank's mortgage.,Whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate.,Whether the finance company's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage.,Whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money liens.,D
"A federal grand jury was convened to investigate the alleged bribery by a foreign government of a special adviser to the President. The grand jury was probing the foreign government's efforts to obtain delivery of transport planes, which were embargoed by the State Department. The Justice Department was trying to ascertain whether the foreign government had offered bribes to the special adviser and other members of the U. S. government in order to secure delivery of the transport planes. The special adviser testified before the grand jury that both he and the President had several conferences with the foreign government's ambassador to the United States. He stated that during these meetings, they discussed problems in their region in general. He denied, however, any involvement in the foreign government's efforts to secure delivery of the transport planes. Two weeks after the special adviser testified, the grand jury returned an indictment, charging him and two other members of the President's staff with conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to defraud the U. S. government. A special prosecutor was then appointed by the Justice Department to prepare the government's case. Upon motion by the special prosecutor, a subpoena duces tecum was issued directing the President to produce the minutes of his meetings with the special adviser and ambassador of the foreign government. The special prosecutor was able to determine the exact dates of the meetings through appointment records that had been previously subpoenaed. The President released several edited transcripts of these conversations.

The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only.

Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots.

During their stay at Yellowstone, the family camped out in a secluded area of the campgrounds surrounded by tall pine trees. Numerous signs had been posted throughout the campgrounds warning campers of the extremely dry conditions prevailing in the forest area due to a summerlong drought. On the morning of their departure, the family cooked breakfast over an open campfire. After breakfast, the family began to pack their gear into the van when the father instructed his 12-year-old son to put out the campfire. The son fetched two pails of water from a nearby pond and tossed the water over the campfire. Believing that he had extinguished the fire, the son joined his family in the van, and they drove away. Unbeknownst to the son and his family, the campfire was still smoldering when they left. Shortly thereafter, a wind gust blew the flames from the fire to some nearby brush. Due to the extremely dry conditions, the brush quickly ignited, starting a raging forest fire. The forest rangers dispatched a firefighting team, which included two helicopters equipped to fight the fire.

"An elevator company installed an elevator in an apartment building. Under the terms of its contract with the owner of the apartment building, the company agreed to carry out regular monthly inspections of the elevator and to make all necessary repairs. The elevator was installed in the apartment complex in January. For the next 10 months, the company made regular inspections. However, starting in November, the company began to have some difficulties with its employees and failed to send inspectors out for three successive months. On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator.

At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse. When the woman resisted, the man struck her, and she fell unconscious. When the woman recovered consciousness, she found herself in a hospital with a concussion and multiple contusions on her body.

Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building. The elevator's stalling was caused by a defective cable that a routine inspection would have discovered.

"A county owns a large expanse of land next to the ocean. Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent.

The prosecutor now seeks to have the expert testify that in her opinion, based on years of experience with drug dealers, the defendant's statement about the apples was code for his having drugs for sale. Should the expert's opinion be admitted?","No, because an expert must base his or her opinion on scientific or technical data, not merely on experience.","No, because the opinion is based on the criminal actions of others engaged in drug dealing, and thus is substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.","Yes, because the opinion is based on her specialized knowledge, and it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue in the case.","Yes, provided that the expert first testifies about the specific information upon which she based her view that the defendant was using ""apples"" as a code word to refer to drugs.",C
"After two men robbed a local bank, they left the bank and went in different directions with a plan to meet three days later at the train station. Two days after the robbeiy, one of the men was involved in an auto accident. The man was rushed to the hospital and taken to the x-ray room. A doctor positioned the man so that the x-ray technician would be able to take x-rays of his lower back area. Based on the man's complaints about the area of pain, the doctor stated, ""It seems as if you might have a fractured pelvis. If you do, you'll have to stay in bed for several weeks. "" The man responded that he couldn't do that because he had to meet the other man tomorrow. A technician who was in the room at the time overheard the man's response to the doctor.

"While on routine patrol, police officers observed a driver make an illegal U-turn. After stopping the driver's car, they observed him reach under the driver's seat. They ordered him out of the car and saw a cellophane package protruding from under the seat. The package contained a white powdery substance, which the officers suspected to be cocaine. The officers placed the driver under arrest and put him in the rear of their patrol car. They then proceeded to search the rest of the driver's car. In the trunk they found an assault rifle that was later determined to be the weapon used in a liquor store robbery. Charged with that robbery, the driver moved to suppress the assault rifle as evidence on the grounds that the police did not have a warrant to search the trunk. The best theory that the prosecution can use in support of the admissibility of the assault rifle as evidence is that",the police conducted an automobile search.,the police conducted an inventory search.,the search was incident to a lawful arrest.,the search was made under exigent circumstances.,A
"As a legislative aide to a U. S. Senator you are called upon to provide an analysis of the constitutionality of a bill pending congressional approval.

"In 1993, a landowner had good record title toa vineyard in fee simple absolute. In 1994, thelandowner delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000,a deed signed by the landowner, naming the son andhis heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the landowner-to-son deed, sought out the landowner and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the vineyard from the landowner to the farmer and his heirs. The landowner executed such a deed, and the farmer promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the vineyard by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the vineyard. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the vineyard to an investor and, for $15,000, paid by the investor, signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard in favor of the investor and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the investor made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a vintner paid the farmer $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the vintner a deed of the vineyard in favor of the vintner and his heirs. The vintner had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior landowner-to-son instrument. Although the vintner did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the vineyard twice a week. The vintner recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a farmer, the investor signed and delivered a deed of the vineyard naming the farmer and his heirs as grantees. Before the farmer had paid the investor and taken his deed, the farmer visited the vineyard and observed the fence. However, the vintner was not present when the farmer visited the property, and nothing suggested who if anyone was using it.

"A man died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter ""to share and share alike as tenants in common. ""At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself.

"A landowner, her aunt, and her brother are the owners of three contiguous lots. A downward slope exists from the landowner's land to the brother'sland. The aunt, the owner in the middle of the three lots, was an amateur scientist. She began experimentation with electricity, using a lightning rod to conduct her experiments. Frequently, the electrical storms apparently originated in and over the area within which the brother's land is located. Because of this, the aunt would often angle her rod over the fence between her property and the brother's property to maximize her chances of success. After one entire rainy and windy season of experiments, the brother had grown tired of the aunt's lightning-rod intrusions because they interfered with his ham radio operations in his garage. The brother brought suit to enjoin such lightning-rod experiments. At trial, it was found that the aunt had been conducting her activities in the airspace directly above the brother's land. The court should",enjoin the aunt's experiments because they constitute an unreasonable interference with the space above the brother's land.,enjoin the aunt's experiments because one does not have the right to engage in such scientific experiment without permission.,not enjoin the aunt's lightning rod experiments if they were necessary to protect her property from the electrical storms.,not enjoin the aunt's experiments because the brother does not own the space above his land.,A

"A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?","The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.","The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.","The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.","The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.",B
"A state has recently enacted a statute prohibiting the sale of computer printer ink cartridges in plastic bags. In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags.

"A husband and wife divorced after 17 years of marriage. They had one son, aged 10. As part of the divorce decree, the wife was given custody of the son, while the husband was entitled to weekend visitation. Thereafter, the husband accepted a new job in a neighboring state. Before relocating, the husband met with an attorney to seek his advice about how he could gain full custody of his son. The attorney told the husband that his new state did not give full faith and credit to divorce proceedings in his former state of residence. As a consequence, the attorney advised the husband that he could take the son to live with him and not be in violation of the law. This was erroneous legal advice, and his new state, in fact, did honor and give full faith and credit to other states' divorce decrees. When his next scheduled visitation took place, the husband picked up his son at his ex-wife's home. Instead of returning his son, he took him to live with him in his new state. After refusing to return his son to his ex-wife, the husband was subsequently arrested and charged with kidnapping.

"Four years ago the owner of a shopping center leased a store in the center for a 10-year term to a pharmacistfor use as a drugstore. The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violationof the covenant in the pharmacist's lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?",The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.,A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.,A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.,The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.,A

"A student was a junior criminology major at state university and a member of a fraternity.

"A recent law school graduate took and passed the bar examination. Before the swearing-in ceremony, however, the graduate received a letter from the bar examiners indicating that his admission would be delayed until a character fitness investigation had been completed.

The graduate had been arrested as a juvenile for possession of marijuana. He was placed in a special drug education program for first- time juvenile offenders and was told that the arrest would be expunged. Since the graduate believed that he had been totally exonerated of criminal liability, he didn't report the arrest on his bar application form. The bar examiners had, in fact, received an anonymous letter making reference to the graduate's juvenile arrest and suggesting that he was not morally fit to be admitted as an attorney.

As part of the investigator's inquiry, he went to the clerk of the juvenile court where the offense occurred and demanded access to the records concerning the graduate. The clerk refused, citing a state statute that required all court and police records relating to juveniles be sealed.

"A county owns a large expanse of land next to the ocean. Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the land, the county leased most of it to a private company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate golf course and country club complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the golf course and country club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee is empowered to set up strict membership ""standards,"" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee is $5,000 and the monthly dues $75 per month. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications for Latino Men, while disapproving and denying all applications of women, African Americans, white Americans, and other minorities. A white resident of the county, upon denial of membership, brings an action against the company seeking injunctive relief to compel his admission claiming that denial of membership to white residents violates his right to equal protection. Which of the following statements is most accurate?",The company will prevail because its denial of membership lacks the requisite state action.,"The plaintiff will win because even though the company is a privately owned corporation, the state has affirmatively encouraged or facilitated its discriminating acts.","The company will win, because the plaintiff lacks standing to assert the rights of discrimination against white Americans as a group.","The plaintiff will win, because denial of membership to white residents cannot be justified by a rational basis.",B
"A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor ""only when expressly accepted by the distributor."" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?","No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.","No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.","Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.","Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.",A
"A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the tract of land. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:""Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property.

"A father died leaving a will by which he devised a 100-acre tract to his daughter. At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will","lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.","lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.","win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.","win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.",B
"An owner had a record store in the downtown business area of a city. A famous rock group was scheduled to perform at the local civic center and the owner featured the band's records in a special sale for the two weeks prior to the concert. In order to promote his sale, the owner installed loudspeakers on the outside of his store window so that he could play the band's records for people walking by to hear. It was the owner's hope that when they heard the records, the passersby would turn into customers and buy the band's records. Subsequently, the owner was cited for violating a city ordinance which provides that:""An owner of property located within the city limits shall not permit to be used on his property any device which causes sounds, other than clock chimes, to be heard upon the street or sidewalk. Violation of this ordinance shall subject the property owner to a fine of $50. 00 for each occurrence. ""If the owner is successful in challenging this ordinance in court, the court would most likely reason that","the ordinance violates equal protection because some sounds are permitted, while others are not.","the ordinance violates the owner's rights of freedom of speech, because there is not valid interest to support the ordinance.","the ordinance violates the owner's rights of freedom of speech, because a municipality may not regulate the use of sound amplification equipment.","the ordinance violates the owner's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, because it is vague in defining unpermitted sounds.",D
"A legislative assistant to a state senator approached various wealthy lobbyists without the senator's knowledge to solicit illegal campaign contributions for the senator's upcoming re-election campaign. The assistant dictated several letters requesting such contributions, which the senator signed without reading, along with a pile of other correspondence. Before the letters were mailed, however, the senator discovered what had happened and then immediately terminated the assistant's employment. Later that same evening, after being notified that he was fired, the assistant returned to the senator's office and used his keys, which had not yet been returned, to enter. The assistant made copies of the letters in question. The following day, the assistant turned over the copies of the letters to an investigative reporter from the local newspaper in the area. The reporter had heard about the assistant's dismissal from another staff member and was curious about all the underlying circumstances. After the assistant provided the reporter with all of the pertinent facts, the reporter wrote a news story regarding the senator's solicitation of illegal campaign contributions. Although the reporter's story was printed in the newspaper, he did not reveal the source of his information. As soon as the publication was made, the FBI initiated an investigation of the senator's campaign finances. If the senator asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the newspaper for the publication of the article concerning the solicitation of illegal campaign contributions, the most likely result is that the senator will","prevail, because the newspaper story placed him in a ""false light in the public eye.

"A woman owned an extensive art collection that she displayed in a special room of her home. While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?","The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.","The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.","The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.","The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.",B

"After learning that a new housing development was about to be built, a developer began looking for property near the housing development on which he could build a shopping center. After an extensive search, he purchased a three-acre undeveloped tract of land for the purpose of developing a small shopping center. At the time the sale was finalized, the developer told his plans to the seller of the three-acre tract, and also mentioned that he was worried whether he had sufficient funds to complete the project. The seller agreed to lend money to the developer to allow for completion of the project. The seller then wrote out the following contract:""In order to help the developer with his plans for development of a shopping center on the three- acre tract he has this day purchased from me, I will lend him $50,000 at 10 percent interest provided he signs a contract with a builder for construction of the shopping center on this tract.

"A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial artists' studios in that city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial figure drawer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this tax","constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.","constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.","unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.","unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.",B

The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is","enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.","enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.","unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.","unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.",C
"A state has had a tremendous influx of retired people in recent years. There has been considerable concern among state health officials who foresee that many of the senior citizens will become victims of price gouging on certain medical supplies and services. In an attempt to curb such fraudulent sales practices, the state legislature has enacted a law prohibiting the sale of hearing aids by non-physicians. The measure provides, however, that all non-physician sellers who are presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids will not be affected. Assume that after the statute goes into effect, a non-physician moves to the state and wants to open a business selling hearing aids. After being advised that the state law prohibits him from doing so, he brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The most likely result is that the state law will be declared","constitutional, because there is a rational basis for distinguishing between non-physicians are not so engaged.","constitutional, because a state has the power to regulate any phase of local business, even though such regulations may have some effect on interstate commerce, provided that Congress has not enacted legislation regarding the subject matter.","unconstitutional, because it denies non- physicians who are not presently engaged in the business of selling hearing aids the equal protection of the law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.","unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause, since Congress has plenary power to regulate any activity that has any appreciable effect on interstate commerce.",A
