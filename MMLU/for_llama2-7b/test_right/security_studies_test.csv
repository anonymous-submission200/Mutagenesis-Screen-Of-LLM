Which of the following is a common criticism of the human security concept?,Human security is neo-colonial.,Human security promotes global capitalism.,Human security is too broad.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following is not one of the 10 steps of the Washington Consensus?,Fiscal Discipline: budget deficits of no more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).,"Tax Reform: broadening the tax base, cut marginal tax rates, improve tax administration.",Property Rights: legal reforms to secure property rights without excessive costs and to regularize the informal sector.,Nationalization: state enterprises should be protected.,D
"Considering commerce and marketing, which of the following present the most significant obstacle to developing IT security?",There is no direct return on investment in building security systems.,"Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.","There is pressure to reduce the time it takes to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time-to-market.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following best describes the 'Orient' according to Edward Said?,"The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West.",The Orient is a geographical term once used to describe the east Asia.,The Orient is an imagined concept that must be rejected by scholars in order to analyse security.,"Where there is an imbalance of power, the Orient is the dominant intellectual force or otherwise superior party.",A
Which of the following best describes the 'subaltern' in postcolonialism?,Subaltern refers to those who are located geographically within the southern hemisphere.,The subaltern is a term applied to a specific group of scholars from the global south.,The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure.,The subaltern refers to the subcontinent of India.,C
How do biological differences affect the roles that men and women must perform for the state?,"Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.","The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.","Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.","Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence.",D
"According to motivational realism, what might inspire the behaviour of so called 'greedy states'?",Human nature is fundamentally greedy.,All of these options.,State desire to increase wealth and prosperity.,State desire to spread its ideology.,B
What has been the effect of biological weapons on national security in the international community?,"The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.","The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. However, the Soviets most likely saw their biological weapons program as a counter to the global-strike complex that was emerging in NATO in the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. Biological weapons programs should therefore be regarded in a Cold War context.","Biological weapons make use of living organisms or toxins to weaken or kill, but because these organisms and toxins occur in nature it makes it difficult to differentiate between naturally occurring disease and subversive activities which, moreover, make a state's capacity hard to verify.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements does not characterise our understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system?,"Infectious disease transcends international borders and, to some extent, divisions of class, gender, education and wealth.","Whilst pandemics present a direct risk to national security, they also have the potential to undermine wider international stability.","Like terrorism, pandemics present a set of threats and risks that are diverse yet interconnected.",The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.,D
"How have the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as international financial institutions (IFIs), affected the development of poorer countries?",Financial policies advocated by the World Bank and IMF were readily adopted by developing countries that sought to bring their economic development into line with wealthier nations. The IFIs focus has been on achieving human security and the promotion of development at a societal level.,"Through the implementation of specific financial policies adopted at the bequest of global financial institutions, many developing countries have gained economic prosperity and the correlating levels of human security.","The World Bank and IMF tend to operate in an economic arena that includes only major financial institutions and wealthy states; coupled with a respect for sovereignty, the scope of such institutions does not reach to interference in national politics.","IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems. Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.",D
How is capitalism defined or regarded within the HM paradigm?,"HM regards capitalism as producing extreme insecurity in its disempowerment of the worker or labourer, from whom the ability to control labour or output is removed by the capitalist.","HM regards the assertion by liberalists and realists that the capitalist economic sphere is non-political to be a misrepresentation, serving the interests of the unelected capitalist elite.",HM regards the capitalist's accumulation of surplus value as a by-product of labour to be exploitation of those labourers by which the value was originally produced.,All of these options.,D
What is Critical Security Studies?,An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.,"A specific theory of security that identifies clearly defined agents, threats, and processes.",A secondary term for the Copenhagen School of Security.,"A study security in which the critical importance of the state, military and traditional security are maintained.",A
How is a process of securitization completed?,"A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.",A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.,"Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.","An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.",D
What role does language play in the process of securitization?,By articulating an issue using the language of security that issue makes the transition from the discursive political realm to the security realm.,"The speech act is the end point of the two-stage process of securitization, at this point the legitimacy of the existential threat is established and the right to employ special measures in addressing the threat is granted to the securitizing actor.","The presentation of an issue as threatening the survival of a referent object is referred to as a speech act. The process of securitization consists of this articulation of the speech act, and accordingly is referred to as a discursive model.","The articulation of an issue as a security threat is referred to as a speech act. This speech act is presented to an audience by a securitizing actor. This actor attempts to convince that audience of the credibility of the issue as an existential threat to a specific referent object. If successful, the audience is convinced and the securitizing actor is granted recourse to legitimately use extraordinary measures in response to the threat.",D
How does the social constructivist approach account for the process of militarization?,"By regarding security as a socially constructed concept, constructivists assert that militarization is the result of governmental decisions based on shared values and cultural norms that underpin their conception of what constitutes a security risk. Accordingly, different governments will identify different threats and react in different ways.","Social constructivists tend to focus on the population rather than military as an area for study, thus regarding the process of militarization largely in terms of its impact on human security.","Social constructivists assert that the process follows a popular recognition of empirically definable threats; when it is recognized that an issue poses a real and valid threat, it warrants militarization.","In their uniform advocacy of human security and adoption of a human-centric approach to security studies, social constructivists regard militarization as a process that is detrimental to achieving wider security goals and actively encourage the demilitarization of the security system.",A
Which of these statements does not describe the liberalist conception of the international system?,International politics is not the same everywhere; it is only 'realist' in certain places at certain times.,The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.,Nation states are not basically alike.,States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.,D
Which of the following might be considered part of the 'deepening and broadening' of security?,The nexus between identity and security.,"War, the military, and the sovereign state.",Environmental changes.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following are true of the Great Law of Peace of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy?,The Great Law alerts scholars to the problem of failing to sustain critique.,The case of the Great Law illustrates the importance of being critical of practices of research and knowledge production.,"The Great Law is a challenge for traditional security studies, as it represents a proven non-state approach.",All of these.,D
In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework explain previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions?,In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.,To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.,Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.,All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.,D
In what way might postcolonial analysis use the term 'thick space'?,"To describe the international as hierarchically ordered and comprised of a dense set of constructed political, economic, social, military and cultural relations.",To describe the international as a space generated by the knowledge and practice of Western powers to favour the so-called third world.,To describe countries that are oppressed or marginalised within imperial readings of IR.,To describe the power embodied by sovereignty and the Westphalian norms that underpin Eurocentric perceptions of the international.,A
How can we define the role of the state in achieving human security?,"The state is the most prominent threat in terms of committing violent acts against humans, thus directly threatening human security.",The state has the greatest material resources and power with which to secure the human referent object.,"In the short term it is unhelpful to adopt a hands-off states and policy approach, as there are many current crises in which people need immediate relief from atrocities.",All of these options.,D
What is the relevance of behaviour in economic security analysis?,"Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors.",The growth of capitalism has catapulted the individual consumer to a place of extreme significance in shaping the global market. The behaviour of consumers dictates the nature of the global system.,"Behaviour, as a social constructivist concern, is not relevant to economic theory or security theory in general.","The behaviour of states is governed by their economic interests, in terms of securing favourable trade agreements and building strong domestic markets. Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations.",A
What long-term trends can be foreseen in the concept of environmental security?,"In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers.",Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behaviour. The relevance will increase until national unilateralist initiatives are taken to retain the social organization of the nation which may have the adverse affect of increasing the prospect of conflict.,"National security practices are the most effective means to achieving environmental security reforms to consolidate the socio-economic organizational base of the country against threat. The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.","The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.",D
"It has been argued by Braun and Chyba (2004) that indigenous nuclear programs are making proliferation safeguards obsolete. In what ways, if any, can a case be made to support this argument?","WMD may provide the means to offset inferiority in conventional armaments compared to regional or superpower rivals. Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community.","Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon. However, whilst nuclear capabilities may be elusive, international or domestic terrorist networks may have the resources to construct and use chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.","WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured. This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time. What separates WMD from conventional weapons is the potential to cause high level destruction. Because of the psychological fear possession can generate, WMD will remain highly desirable as a political weapon.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements is true within the postcolonial approach?,The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others.,European practices of free trade and democracy are best suited to creating a peaceful and stable international system.,"With the end of the Second World War and gradual dissolution of the British Empire, much of postcolonialism is redundant.",Colonial power exists only through the military actions of occupying states.,A
Traditional approaches seek to explain why and how states have sought security. Which answer best describes the approach of traditional Security Studies?,"Traditional theories explain international politics as the distribution of power among members of an international system, and specifically as the balance of power amongst major states. The relative power and the constraints of a state are reflective of the security strategy of that state.","The traditional approaches emerged in response to the Cold War, and to the accumulation of tension and competition between the two Superpowers. Traditional theories seek to explain behaviour in terms of arms accumulation.","Traditional conceptions emerged to explain the clusters of norms and patterns of behaviour that result in management of conflict and cooperation in the international system, in specific spheres of activities.","Traditional approaches are concerned with sovereignty. Sovereignty is a legal status; it gives the state control over a specified territory, means it is free from arbitrary intervention, and is responsible to no higher authority. Traditional theories examine the patterns of behaviour and relative cooperation of sovereign states in the international system.",D
What is the relationship between historical materialism and the global justice movement?,"Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.",Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.,"Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.","Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.",D
What is the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention?,"In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.","Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.","State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.","The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.",D
In what ways have post-Cold War developments undermined state authority?,"The increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.",The wave of political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism since the 1980s - a phenomenon which frequently occurred simultaneously in the same country - have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition.,The sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe also created a new generation of refugees. These diasporas have provided the family and ethnic ties that help facilitate a transnational criminal enterprise.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following is essential to societal security?,Sovereignty.,Identity.,All of these options.,Hegemonic ethnicity.,B
What is the value of a post-structuralist critique in security studies?,To enable us to understand the workings of political subjecthoods left out of traditional discourses on security.,"To examine the base of power and its construction, in greater depth than traditional analysis.",To challenge the idea that smart weapons and technology are the active subjects determining security today.,All of these.,D
What challenges to liberalism were shown by the Western response to the Arab Spring?,"The problematic contention that the liberalist perspective is based on ideas that are Western - such as democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights.","Liberalism did not provide a clear way to deal with the Arab Spring, and its inconsistencies and contradictions were exposed.","The liberalist perspective does not explain clearly how and when liberalism is supposed to spread, in this case to the Arab countries in question.",All of the above,D
Which of the following is NOT one of the 3 forms of violence identified by postcolonialism?,Material violence.,Epistemic violence.,Structural violence.,Pervasive violence.,D
What techniques and targets belong to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns?,"Suicide attacks have been employed by terrorists having the advantage of enabling detonation at the last minute or when casualties will be maximized. A potential future danger is that a suicide attack could be combined with the use of chemical, biological or radiological weapons.","The ability to find vulnerable targets may be greater in democratic states since there are limitations on how much a government can monitor its citizen and will, in the event of an attack, generate more publicity. However, security forces in weak non-democratic countries also provide conditions conducive to terrorist activity, enabling relative freedom of operation and movement.","WMD have not been used very often, requiring high levels of resources and trained personnel for use. Furthermore, most terrorist groups still prefer to use more predictable methods for inflicting maximum casualties on the target. Yet to some extent, terrorist groups have gained a psychological edge because of the fear of use of WMD.",All of these options.,D
In what ways do environmental issues present a concern for peace researchers in the twenty-first century?,"Environmental constraints can limit conventional economic growth, posing a direct threat to economic security and development.","Environmental changes, such as rising sea levels, can threaten the land on which populations are settled as well as their access to resources. Migration as a result of these changes presents threats to societal, economic and other sectors of security.",Environmental degradation and increased demand for resources is likely to lead to scarcity and result in conflict.,All of these options.,D
There is a need to establish the nature and consequences of insecurity in the developing world. Why is this?,Empirically there is a need to understand why virtually all war and major political violence since 1945 continues to take place in the developing world and why the majority originates from internal rather than external sources. Between 20 - 30 million have lost their lives in more than one hundred intra-state wars and there are 20 - 40 wars ongoing in any given year.,"Conceptually there is a need to find appropriate theories and concepts that accommodate the unique character of the security situation in the developing world; intra-state war, communal violence, poverty, famine, weapons proliferation, crime, political instability, socio-economic breakdown and state collapse.","From a normative perspective there are clear humanitarian imperatives to resolve the lack of security; 90 per cent of victims of intra-state violence are civilians, half a million are killed by light weapons, 40,000 a year die from hunger and poverty whilst tens of millions die from disease, chronic poverty, and inadequate health, education, employment, and environmental causes.","All of these options. There is a profound disjuncture between security in developed nations and the kind of security in the world's ""zones of instability"". From a global perspective insecurity is more of a norm than security is. However, globalization essentially means that these forms of insecurity cannot be contained within increasingly porous national borders.",D
"When considering the international system from a realist perspective, which of the following statements concerning the advent of war is true?","War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.","War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.","War is more likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states.",All of these options.,D
How do gun shows and international arms fairs contribute to illicit arms markets?,"Although the subject of vocal opposition by campaigners, gun shows employ strict legal restrictions on participants, ensuring that those with criminal records are not able to purchase weapons.",Gun shows are regulated to ensure that weapons purchased legally cannot be resold on the black or grey markets.,Gun shows and arms fairs do not contribute in a significant way to the trade in illicit arms.,"Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used.",D
Which of the following was not stated as an objective of the Commission on Human Security when it was launched?,"To promote public understanding, engagement and support of human security and its underlying imperatives.",To develop the concept of human security as an operational tool for policy formulation and implementation.,To propose a concrete program of action to address critical and pervasive threats to human security.,To develop a new international justice system to enhance human security.,D
"In terms of cyber-security, what is meant by 'resilience' and why is it important?",Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.,The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.,Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.,Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.,D
Has TNC become a national security threat?,"Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities. Additionally, criminals often reinvest their proceeds in the legal economy and have unfair advantage through access to cheap capital and their ability to intimidate commercial adversaries. In societies with high levels of TNC, legitimate investors are often reluctant to commit resources.","TNC undermines democratic stability. In many states, transnational criminal enterprises have taken advantage of the instability that has accompanied the democratic transitions to post communist societies, using their influence in the upper reaches of the state and thus shielding themselves from law enforcement. The corruption of public institutions and the perceived inefficacy of the rule of law in new democracies contribute to undermining public confidence in and loyalty to the new regime.","The ability of transnational crime to evade state border controls and provide new avenues for the illicit transportation of goods and persons challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, the monopolization over the control of force, and as the provider of the common good. TNC criminal activities corrupt and undermine numerous state agencies, providing mechanisms by which their activities can affect the very nature of government and state policy in the host countries.",All of the above are correct.,D
Which of the following events can be regarded as contributing to the emergence of environmental security during the 1960s and 1970s?,"From the 1970s a number of scholars attempted to critique orthodox security discourse and practices, highlighting their inability to manage environmental risks to national and international security.",There became a growing recognition that environmental changes do not merely pose risks to ecosystems - they also pose risks to human well-being.,A shared environmental consciousness emerged in developing countries.,All of these options.,D
"Prior to the late 20th century the role of women in war had been neglected as an area of concern in security studies, for what reason?",Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security.,"The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.",The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.,"Women are generally unsupportive of warfare and prefer to engage in anti-war or opposition movements, rendering their contribution to the study of warfare as marginal.",B
What are the main criticisms of the realist argument against humanitarian intervention?,Realist opposition to humanitarian intervention is based on assumptions that states will protect their citizens.,The realist position overlooks the responsibilities that are inherent to sovereignty.,Critics of humanitarian intervention overlook the wide body of international law relating to basic human rights and the consensus on grave crimes such as genocide.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements best describes our understanding of the term 'globalization'?,"Globalization refers to the process by which shared hegemonic values pervade societies across the globe, drawing them into an ideological community, most often based on the economic principles of capitalism.","Best described as intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, globalization is the result of the compression of space and time through the development of new technologies.","Globalization is best described as the 'shrinking' of the global community, drawing people into closer contact with one another primarily at the economic and technical levels. This process began in the early 20th century and was based on the ideological expeditions that originated from western Europe.","Globalization has occurred since the 1980s, originating in Western Europe as a centre of political power and technological advancement. The process is a direct result of technological advancement in communications and travel industries that facilitate the efficient transportation of physical objects, people and ideas across the globe.",B
In what ways may weak states be challenged externally?,"Powerful states may employ diplomatic pressures to ensure that weak states comply with international norms. This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups.","Weak states are threatened by the proliferation of small arms which can be used in a challenge to the authority of the state. Small and light weapons are purchasable through legal and illegal channels and are prevalent in regions with warlords, criminals and private militias.","Weak states cannot remain isolated from processes of globalization. Increasingly porous borders lead to migration and immigration. In order to compete in a globalized market weak states look to secure financial-credit assistance or aid from international institutions. However, these processes undermine the hegemonic idea of the state and societal identity is blurred which makes it difficult for the state to sustain its ideological appeal.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following is applicable when considering the concept of security dilemmas in terms of societal identity?,"For societal security dilemmas ambiguity can stem from two sides of nationalism; cultural (positive) and ethnic (negative). Ethnic (political) nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures.",Clear distinctions between cultural nationalism and political nationalism are difficult to make: cultural nationalism may sometimes be compelled to change itself from a solely cultural movement into a political movement and be conflated with political nationalism.,Dominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action reaction processes.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements does NOT characterize arms control as a strategic policy?,"Arms control is an example of cooperative security, designed to address the problems associated with the security dilemma.",Policies of arms control and disarmament was pursued during the Cold War in an attempt to achieve security.,"Arms control does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships.","After its successful application during the Cold War, arms control has retained its momentum and applicability in the contemporary security environment.",D
What are the types of terrorism? Are all groups the same?,"Religious terrorism seems to be one of the hallmarks of the post-Cold War age. Religious terrorism is understood to denote the extremist activities of Islamic fundamentalism. Al-Qaeda is the most prominent example of religious terrorist groups and is described as globally operational, although religious terrorism is not limited to the al-Qaeda network. Christian beliefs were used to justify the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, as well as anti-abortionist assassinations in the USA.","Terrorist groups have drawn their ideas from ideologies. There was a wave of terrorist violence in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s rooted in various leftist and Marxist ideologies but these began to wane by the late 1980s. Right-wing groups are also present, often with overtly xenophobic and racist views, targeting migrants and foreign workers.","Groups defined by their ethnic or linguistic identifications are a broad category for the organization of terrorist groups. In some countries a large number of anti-colonial groups were ethnically based and used terrorist tactics in the wars of liberation. Such loyalties and tactics have in some cases proved immutable post-independence. Ethnic and linguistic affiliation has proved a powerful motivation for terrorist actions when combined with territory, and ethnic independence from another ethnic group.",All of the above are correct.,D
Which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s?,"Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies.","In contrast to the realist school, peace researchers looked beyond the accumulation of nuclear weapons for a focus to their studies; this resulted in tensions between the two groups, with the former believing that the attainment of superior military strength was paramount to achieving security.","Whilst peace researchers indentified the escalation of the arms race as a result of failures by the League of Nations, realist scholars deemed it to be the natural progression of ideological differences between the Soviet bloc and Western liberal democracies. This resulted in irreconcilable differences between the study agendas of realists and peace researchers.","The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric.",D
Which of the following security sectors are intrinsically linked with energy security?,Economic and development security.,Regime and international security.,Environmental and human security.,All of these options.,D
What is the relationship between HM and realism?,Both HM and realism are based on the notion that there exist within society certain discernable realities.,"HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus.","Whilst HM recognises the importance of the state as an actor within the international system, it also purports that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite.",All of the above,D
What factors enabled the expansion of transnational crime (TNC) in the 1990s?,"Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.",TNC as a concept emerged in the academic sphere as linked to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe.,"Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.",International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.,D
Why do so many feminist scholars regard the exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat as important?,"Veterans of armed conflict may be rewarded by gaining powerful offices, often in political positions and in state institutions.","Participation in military activity is often regarded as a sign of strength, patriotism and courage.",The foundations for decisions not to allow female participation are commonly based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways.,All of these options.,D
"In what ways is the case for humanitarian intervention, as outlined in this chapter, limited?",It is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights.,Advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights.,Any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states.,All of these options.,D
"In the contemporary context, how can peace studies best be defined?","Following the expansion of peace studies in the decline of the Cold War, the field has emerged as an independent and autonomous area of study that addresses issues surrounding conflict resolution, economic security and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. As a field of research, peace studies are best defined by their distinction from development studies and international relations.","Peace studies are best defined by its research agenda that focuses on the search for non-violent measures by which to end conflict. Peace researchers adopt a 'top-down' approach to conflict resolution that prioritises the issues surrounding violence and the use of force, focusing on instigating agents in an attempt to secure that actor as the referent object to security.","Peace studies cannot be defined as a specific academic approach due to the shifting nature of its research agenda and the diversity of interests addressed by peace researchers. However, following the Cold War the success of the field has been such that it boasts a number of research institutes and attracts global and interdisciplinary attention.","Peace studies is defined by a concern with the underlying causes of phenomena in IR, a global outlook, an interdisciplinary approach, the search for non-violent transformations, an analytical and normative approach, and the adoption of multi-level analysis that links theory and practice within research.",D
Which of these statements defines the Copenhagen School's view of security?,"Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.","Security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible.","To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.","Security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied.",A
Which of these best describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity?,The inherent promotion of feminine characteristics in society.,Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.,All of these options.,The acknowledgement that gender identity exists in many forms and is not binary.,B
How do institutional constraints affect behaviour?,Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them.,Institutions are the social norms and expectations that affect an actor's goals and ambitions.,"Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.","Institutions are humanly devised constrains that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behaviour.",D
Which of the following policies is not true of economic policy?,"Economic policies must take into account the incentives of not only the leaders, but the populations intended to influence.",Policymakers can incentivize security-promoting behaviours in others through the use of sanctions and aid.,"Trade policies can entice leaders to change behaviours in exchange for access to markets or trade preferences, and advance security.","Concern with poverty is a humanitarian issue that has no direct link to economic science, although it might be alleviated through aid.",D
Which of the following is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian inventions?,Armed force should only ever be used in the national interest and that humanitarian intervention is therefore imprudent.,"Foreign intervention reduces the proportion of wars that end in outright victory, it leaves behind an unstable peace that is likely to reignite.",Foreign intervention tends to prolong wars; it is inappropriate and does not work.,"Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism.",D
"Why, in the contemporary studies of security, is the subject of energy security so important?","There exists an array of contemporary challenges to energy security, ranging from resource scarcity concerns to dangers of political instability.",The existence of reliable supplies of energy determines the ability of a nation to achieve economic development.,"Energy security encompasses a broad range of issues that are both contemporary and fundamental to security, ranging from the local and individual to the global scale.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following statements best describes the orientation of military security within the traditional conception of security studies?,"Strategic studies are the central concern of international relations, within strategic studies, the subset of security studies focuses on military security.","Military security is a central concern within international relations and dominates the scholarship. Within international relations, strategic studies form a subset of academic interest, within which security studies feature occasionally.","Strategic studies are best conceptualized as a subset of international relations, and within strategic studies, military security is one of the dominant concerns. Security studies are a subset of strategic studies.","Military security is the central concern of strategic studies; and strategic studies are a subset of security studies. Military security is one of the central concerns of security studies, and security studies is a subset of international relations.",D
Which of the following is not a common criticism of Securitization?,A loose and broad conceptualization of security can lead to vagueness and a lack of conceptual and analytical coherence.,"When the securitizing actor is not the state, it can be unclear what would constitute an extraordinary measure.","The model relies on a definition of distinctive political and security realms, which are not always clearly defined.",The theory of securitization lacks coherence in terms of its employment as a tool for analytical studies in security.,D
"Which of these statements characterizes the traditional concept of national security, as opposed to human security?",All of these options.,"In the national security approach, real threats are only those posed to human life, human rights, or human dignity.",The traditional interpretations of security and threats are important boundaries that define human security.,The concept of national security is too narrow to be useful when analysing the broad threats that currently exist.,D
Which of the following conditions does not constitute 'human security'?,"A condition where people are given relief from the traumas that afflict human development, are safe from threats and are protected from hurtful disruptions to their daily lives.","A condition in which every citizen is free from the threat of physical violence, regardless of their race, ethnicity or other identity.","A condition where people are guaranteed the ability to live and develop, free from political oppression or prejudice, safe from threats posed by their own or external state actors.","A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely.",D
What are the effects of nuclear weapons?,"A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), ""the Compton effect."" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.",A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.,"Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.",All of the above,D
Security studies can be interpreted as an imperial field of knowledge in which of the following ways?,Security studies emerged in relation to the interests of the USA and Britain following the Second World War.,Security studies adopts a perspective which postcolonial scholars refer to as 'the colonizer's view of the world'.,Security studies was originally defined by the power of the USA and Britain at a time when they actively supported colonial and imperial relations in the global south.,All of these options.,D
How might we understand the terms gender and gender security?,Gender security is essentially an extension of the way in which we conceptualize the international political system. The analysis of gender security relations has only been made possible by the expansion of the traditional military definition of security in which national security in anarchical international society was the exclusive province of the male.,"To study gender security is to focus on the role of adult women in modern warfare, including industries related to warfare, and their inclusion or exclusion from combat roles.","The issue of gender and security is understood as the practical conceptualization of ways in which women have a role in security related issues, and their relative inclusion and exclusion in military conflict and militarization.","The study of gender and of gender security issues is a complex task, and both terms elude a uniform definition. The concept of gender security broadens terms of security beyond the military sector to also include 'human security'.",D
"Which of the following best describes what is meant by security in the contemporary world, according to the field of Security Studies?","'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.","'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.","'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.",None of the above,D
Which of these is an effective way of securing against cyber threats?,Complete eradication of threats.,"Ensure that the severity of cyber war as a threat is recognised, and that instances of cyber warfare are identified, publicised, and acted upon immediately.",All of these options.,"Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience.",D
Which of the following are trends to emerge in the global defence trade since the end of the Cold War?,"A growing effort by governments to prevent the spread of weapons, especially of WMDs.",A growth in volume of the arms trade.,"A change in the nature of the defence trade, linked to the changing nature of conflict.",All of these options.,D
What is the significance of anarchy to the realist explanation of international politics?,Anarchy means that the state exists as part of society being indistinguishable from national government and the domestic character of the state.,"Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.","Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies.","Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important.",B
Which of the following ideas have become mainstreamed within human security since the Human Development Report?,Limiting security analysis to military engagement is too restrictive.,Security is a contestable concept.,Focusing security only on violent conflicts is too restrictive.,All of these options.,D
Which statement best defines the term 'international regime' in relation to liberalism?,The term international regime refers to the governmental or political apparatus that defines the state within the international system.,The term refers to a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject.,International regimes are independent bodies established by a collaboration of governmental and non-state actors to oversee international decision-making processes.,"International regimes are also known as international organisations and play a fundamental role as lobbyists, advocating the views of interest groups to state actors.",B
How does the preoccupation with human rights affect the human rights orientated school of liberalism?,Modern human rights oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination.,Human rights orientated liberalism will advocate separatism where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it.,"Human rights orientated liberalism is particularly focused on persons subject to economic, sexual, gender, religious, and political persecution, discrimination, or deprivation.",All of these options.,D
What would be the policy implications of a hierarchical vision of TNC?,Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.,"The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.",Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.,Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.,D
What are the specific elements of a comprehensive national defence trade control system?,"Governments should include in their arms trade rules, laws, penalties for their violation.",Governments should ensure that weapons producers mark their defence items with a unique marking.,"Government police and military forces should establish appropriate weapons stockpile security measures and national authorities should collect and destroy old, outdated, and excess weaponry.",All of these options.,D
In what ways is gender applicable to the field of Security Studies?,Women and children are dependent on the state for protection and Security Studies should include them and account for their needs.,Biological differences between men and women determine their suitability for different roles in protecting the state or referent object.,Gender is not applicable to Security Studies - to create a 'gender neutral' security arena we should disregard gender issues.,"Social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' determine the roles in which men and women are expected to act, by considering these artificial roles we can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.",D
What is the function of sanctions?,As a means of exerting economic power to advance peace and freedom.,To end economic support for morally unacceptable regimes.,To isolate dangerous regimes and weaken threats to regional or global security.,All of these options.,D
Which of the following is not a correct definition?,Acting subjects: who or what is acting to produce security or insecurity.,Substantive content: what being secure looks like and what conditions must exist for us to be able to say we are secure.,Referent object: whom or what we act to make secure.,"Objective security: when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation.",D
How might weapons belonging to state military or police forces arrive on the illicit arms market?,States are strong enough to ensure that their weaponry is kept within their control and not traded illegally.,There is no evidence to suggest that state-owned weapons could be traded illicitly as part of the black or grey arms markets.,Illegal trading by states is the primary way in which weapons purchased legally might end up on the illegal arms market.,"Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.",D
In what ways has human security been significant as a concept?,"Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects.","From a normative perspective, the concept serves to highlight good global norms. Human security often serves as an umbrella norm. Developing good global norms is not only important for moral and ethical reasons but also because they serve to enhance state and international society.","The development of the human security concept highlights the view that the threats to humans as well as to state entities are changing and increasing. These changes have spurred debates about the meaning of security and the arguments for its broadening and deepening. Like internal violence, these transnational issues have serious local, regional, and global effects.",All of these options.,D
In what ways might the effects of chemical weapons affect the decision to deploy them against a target?,"Chemical weapons are a highly complicated means to conduct an assault. The unpredictability of chemicals (the degree of evaporation, stability and concentration) frequently proves to be incommensurate with political objectives.","Analysts are concerned with the potential ease of chemical manufacturing. Weapons could be quickly and effectively deployed being light, concealable and rapidly deployed. Most weapons can be delivered in a line source for example a crop duster or administered through an aerosol. Dispersal in areas of poor ventilation or closed venues where people are in close proximity could have potentially catastrophic effects.",Chemical weapons have the potential to cause mass casualties. Moderate exposure to chemicals produces serious side effects and would generate serious casualties if weaponized.,"Wind, temperature and terrain can affect the lethality and persistence of an agent and is dependent on the extensity and degree of contact with the target.",D
In what ways is defining coercive diplomacy success problematic?,"Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the ""stick"" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.","Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.","In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.","Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.",D
"In what ways, if any, can the environment be considered a security concern?","Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.","Environmental security is a critical security project in that it questions who and what is to be secured and from what threat by orthodox security policies, or whether linkages between environmental, security and development issues can be made.","Environmental security is a practical endeavour to assess how environmental change causes violent conflict within and between countries, and the ways in which environmental security can undermine national security.","All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested.",D
What is the relationship between culture and social constructivism?,All of the below.,"Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed.","Social constructivism does not regard culture as being an important feature to study, instead focusing on individualistic aspects of identity such as personal interests and ambition.",Culture is commonly regarded as a set of practices that give meaning to shared experiences and actions; it can impact on how states see security and is crucial in constructing the values and rules that inform identity.,D
Which of the following is an impact of common structural adjustment policies on the poor?,"Cost of imports soar, including vital resources such as imported medicines. Basic food prices rise, putting even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets.","Reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors.",Massive redundancies and increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business.,All of these options.,D
What are Fission Nuclear Weapons?,Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion.,"Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of ""going critical"".","Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion.","Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.",D
Which of the following statements best describes the process of 'medicalization'?,The term 'medicalization' refers to the process whereby a medical or health issue becomes securitized.,'Medicalization' is the outcome of security dialogue that discusses threats or risks to national security in terms of medical language.,"An issue is said to be 'medicalized' when it is dismissed as a security threat, instead deemed to be a medical issue concerning health as mutually exclusive from security.",The perceived 'medicalization' of societies occurs when social issues are increasingly considered and responded to as medical problems.,D
How has the conceptualization of health as a security issue changed during the twentieth century?,Health has long been regarded as a security issue. During the 20th century there was an increasingly sense of panic about the potential damage of a serious pandemic disease outbreak in the newly globalised world. Medical advances and a series of successful contained outbreaks have largely allayed these fears.,Since the early 20th century there has been growing recognition of the success in medical and technological advancements that have the ability to keep infectious diseases at bay in the modern population.,"Pandemic disease is a relatively new threat to security, emerging only in the early 19th century. Therefore, human populations are still formulating and testing new ways of controlling outbreaks and minimising their impact on security.","During the 20th century, security analysts were predisposed to focus on the potential threat of nuclear confrontation and military combat. Since the reduction in these threats, there has emerged a series of pandemic diseases, and a sense of growing unease at the future impact of more serious outbreaks in an increasingly globalised population.",D
Which of these statements is commonly regarded as a tangible benefit of the securitization process?,Securitizing injects urgency into an issue and leads to a sustained mobilization of political support and deployment of resources.,Securitization encourages more efficient handling of complex problems.,Securitization mobilizes popular support for policies in specific areas by calling them security relevant and encourages the allocation of more resources.,All of these options.,D
In what ways might a society be threatened?,Societies are threatened when their linguistic heritage and traditions are under attack. The inability to use and develop traditional language signifies the destruction of a society.,Threats to societal security exist when a society regards its collective identity as being under question. Such circumstances include the suppression of expression and interference with a society's ability to reproduce itself across generations.,"Military threats to societies in the form of external aggression, mainly through de-population policies with the intent of preventing collective identities from being reproduced over generations.",Migratory influxes into a host receiving state results in a shift in the composition of the population resulting in horizontal competition or vertical competition. This is not an outright threat to survival but part of wider uncontrollable processes of evolutionary identity.,B
Which of these statements best defines the concepts of corporate and social identity?,"An actor can have only one social identity, and this forms the basis for developing other identities. In contrast, an actor may have multiple corporate identities which vary in importance.","Corporate identity refers to the intrinsic, self-realized identity of an actor. Social identity refers to 'sets of meanings that an actor attributes to itself while taking the perspective of others'. Actors can have multiple social identities.",Corporate identity is a type of social identity that is constructed through the interaction of an actor with others within the international system.,"Social identity can also be described as 'role' identity. Like corporate identity, an actor's social identity is formed through interaction and does not exist as an intrinsic concept.",B
In what ways has conflict been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states?,"Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.","Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.","Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.",Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.,D
Which of the following reasons might influence a state's decision to join an alliance such as NATO?,More powerful states may also create alliances in order to extend their protective umbrella over weaker friendly states.,States may seek to join an alliance if they believe that their own resources are inadequate to maintain their sovereignty and security.,An alliance can become attractive to states when a potential hegemonic power threatens the other states in that system.,All of these options.,D
Historical materialism is founded on the ideas and philosophies of which theorists?,Barry Buzan and Ole Waever,Kenneth Waltz and Hans Morgenthau,Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels,Adam Smith and Karl Marx,C
In what ways does the perspective on terrorism influence the response a government will take?,"Within the disease prescription, reform packages become part of the government response to reduce the appeal of the terrorist group within the population. However, reforms may encourage terrorists to continue their violent activities because they are being rewarded. Under these conditions reforms may become concessions that fuel the violence rather than a mechanism for ending it. It is also clear that reforms may not eliminate the presence of terrorism.","Contemporary responses to terrorism have been taken within the context of the war on terror analogy, in which the norms of retaliation and punishment prevail. Implicit within this view is the justification for pre-emptive action taken against training facilities, headquarters, sources of funding, and even the assassination of key individuals.","Whilst the warfare analogy presumes deterrence at times, deterrence is more central to a justice system. The extent of pre-emption available in a normal criminal context is the detention of suspects or judicial harassment.","All of these options. Responses to terrorist attacks vary either explicitly or implicitly, if warfare is seen as warfare, crime, or disease.",D
How might the period of academic institutionalization be assessed?,"The distinct phenomenon of strategic studies emerged as an imported American specialty. It emerged in the US and was exported to Europe. European security studies was ""theory has already been done"" kind of work.",The think tanks became routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving succumbing to 'hectic empiricism': the internal logic of its key contribution (deterrence) broke down.,"Peace research developed on a parallel but separate track, and particularly the distinct critical branch was seen neither by its representatives nor by security studies as part of the latter.",All of these options.,D
In what ways may the security dimensions of infectious disease be considered in the national security framework?,"The physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personal operate, particularly during combat.","The innate human fear of microbes makes them particularly amenable to being portrayed not just as important health issues, but as national-security threats as well.","Diseases that traditionally affect certain regions of the world, due to their epidemiologic nature or for socio-economic reasons, are increasingly perceived by national governments as potential threats as a result of globalisation.",All of these options.,D
"The concept of R2P rests on three pillars, which of these is widely acclaimed to be the most important?",The responsibility to retaliate.,The responsibility to prevent.,The responsibility to rebuild.,The responsibility to react.,B
Which of the following best describes Eurocentrism?,Eurocentrism is a style of analysis in which European societies are compared to non-European societies to produce an unbiased comparison of the relative merits of each.,Eurocentrism is a thought style in which the assessment and evaluation of non-European societies is couched in terms of the cultural assumptions and biases of Europeans.,Eurocentrism describes studies or scholarly work that only consider European political or economic systems.,All of these options.,B
What is meant by the term 'cyber-crime'?,Any crime that uses computers to jeopardise or attempt to jeopardise national security,The use of computer networks to commit financial or identity fraud,The theft of digital information,Any crime that involves computers and networks,D
What is the future of WMD?,"The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.",The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.,Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War. A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange.,"WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.",D
"For post-structuralists, which of the following is the most important impact of security studies?",Security studies contributes to the literature and builds greater theoretical understanding of the subject.,Security studies records the history of modern warfare.,Security studies teaches a new generation about the reality of warfare and strategy.,"Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others.",D
In what ways can the different relationship between US and European security studies be explained?,"The different relationship to the concept of security: in Europe the debate has stayed as part of politico-self-reflection of the scholar who 'does security;' whereas in the US, the question of the concept of security is seen at the most a necessary 'define your' terms' operation.","The different relationship to the exact form of knowledge that is valued. The US is more rationalist, Europe the more reflectivist. In the US security studies debate hypothesis is typically examined as cause-effect relationships, tied into general debates and with measurement of ideational variables.","In the US major competing explanations emphasized, on the one hand, the US's liberal hegemony, and, on the other hand, the purely power based stability of presumed unipolarity in which balancing becomes impossible.",All of these options.,D
In what ways can a distinction be made between limited force and full-scale force?,The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.,Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.,"The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.",D
What are the challenges for the future of security studies?,"The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.",The fate of security studies depends on its ability to prevail in the general debates in the discipline of IR. It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.,"Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order. This picture shows that there will be a lot of points of contact between the currently disconnected fields of theory.",All of these options.,D
Which of the following is the odd one out?,Institutional constraints and resource constraints.,Information and time horizon.,Goals.,Vectors of economic incentives.,D
