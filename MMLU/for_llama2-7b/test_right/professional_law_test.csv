"An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot.

"A rancher is the owner of a ranch situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is a 40-acre farm that is owned by a farmer. There is a stream, which is a non-navigable watercourse, that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into the valley below. Both the ranch and the farm are within the watershed of the stream. When the farmer purchased the farm in 1974, he began taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1974, the southern half of the farm had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and unused except for an occasional hike or gathering of timber for use as domestic fuel. The farmer continued this established pattern of use. Now (January 2010), he is still taking water from the stream and using it to irrigate the southern half of the farm. In 2008, the rancher built a home on the ranch and began taking water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. The next year, however, there was a drought. As a result, the stream flowed at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the farmer's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one quarter of the farmer's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. Inasmuch as the stream is still flowing at a very low level and the rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs, there is insufficient water to irrigate the farm. As a consequence, the farmer brings an appropriate action to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the farmer moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?","The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.","The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and protected against an agricultural use.","The farmer, because he has obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.","The farmer, because he has put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.",D

Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. Assuming that on January 10, the rancher conducted a title search that revealed the friend's mortgage on the property, which of the following is correct?",The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.,The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.,"The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.",The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.,D
"A law school professor was hired to teach a bar review course. The professor taught the course in three cities. After conducting the sessions, the professor submitted an expense report to the owner of the bar review course. Her expense voucher included a $225 travel expenditure to a fourth city where the professor had attended a symposium unrelated to the bar review course. The professor also submitted the $225 travel expenditure to the administrator for the faculty at the law school where she teaches. The dean of the law school had previously approved the professor's appearance at the symposium. The owner paid the professor for the symposium-related expenditure but indicated that the expense item was improperly billed to his company. The professor was indicted for false pretenses.

"A developer was the owner of a 300-acre tract of land that was located in a rural county. Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road. After the woman used the private road for approximately two months, a teacher who was an owner within the residential subdivision, ordered the woman to discontinue using the private road. In an appropriate action by the teacher against the woman to enjoin the use of the private road, the woman will","win, because there is an easement by estoppel over the private road.","win, because there is an implied easement appurtenant over the private road.","lose, unless the private road is the only access road by which woman can gain ingress and egress to her property.","lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.",D

"A company owns and operates a chemical plant that manufactures paraquat, an herbicide used primarily as a weed killer. The plant is located in a rural area in the southwestern part of the state. In its production of paraquat, the company emits putrid smelling fumes throughout the surrounding countryside. Although the fumes are harmless to health, they are rank and highly offensive. Despite extensive research by the company to alleviate the problem, there is no known way to manufacture paraquat without discharging malodorous fumes into the air. An owner of a large dairy farm that is adjacent to the plant finds the foul-smelling herbicide fumes to be extremely unpleasant and totally objectionable. The owner brings an action based on private nuisance against the company and seeks to enjoin the manufacture of paraquat at the chemical plant. Which of the following facts, if proven, will be most helpful to the company's defense?","Federal, state, and local agencies approved the design of the plant and equipment used to produce paraquat.","The company has a contract with the federal government whereby it supplies 80 percent of its paraquat production to the Drug Enforcement Agency, which uses the herbicide as a marijuana eradicator.",The company commenced the manufacture of paraquat at the plant before the owner acquired the land and built his dairy farm.,"Paraquat is the only herbicide that can safely and effectively kill marijuana, which, if not controlled, poses a serious drug-enforcement problem.",D

"A teacher is the owner in fee simple of a seven-acre quarry, on which he maintains a dwelling house for himself and his family. Adjoining the quarry to the west is a 10-acre ranch, owned by a librarian. In order to gain access to the highway, the teacher has been granted an easement to cross over the ranch using the road along the ranch's southernmost boundary. The teacher has recently purchased a 12-acre farm, which abuts the ranch, but is not appurtenant to the quarry. Directly north of the farm is the ranch and directly west is the highway.

Both the pedestrian and the purchaser suffered injuries. The pedestrian asserted a claim based on negligence against the bicycle company. At trial, it was found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, and that the bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have led to the discovery of the existence of the defect.

"A police department filed a complaint charging Bill with the sale of narcotic drugs in violation of a state statute and obtained a valid warrant for his arrest. Two police officers went to Bill's house, a two-story colonial. After knocking at the door, they were admitted by Bill's brother, Mark. One of the policemen showed Mark the arrest warrant and asked if he was Bill. He replied that he was Bill's brother and that he was staying at his brother's house while Bill was away on a business trip. The police officer then asked Mark for some identification. Mark was only able to produce an out-of-state driver's license. The other policeman then became suspicious and proceeded to frisk Mark. During the pat-down, the police officer found the following letter, which read:""Dear Mark,If you could get rid of your brother permanently, we could be together forever. With love,your favorite girl. ""Nervously, Mark then agreed to allow the policemen to search the house. The officers conducted an extensive two-hour search of the house and found nothing of interest to them. As they were leaving, one of the police officers walked over to a parked car in the driveway of the house and noticed that the car's trunk was slightly open. When he looked in the trunk, the police officer discovered Bill's body.

On Feb. 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Sec. 204 and passed Sec. 205a. It reduced the good time credits for anyone convicted from that date onward, and also for anyone in prison as of the date of the section's passage. The new release date was calculated to be Jan. 1, 2009. The criminal defendant brought a habeas corpus action arguing that Sec. 205a was an unenforceable ex post facto law as to him. The state courts turned him down saying that good time credit was a privilege and not a vested right. The case ultimately came before the U.S. Supreme Court. Did the Supreme Court invalidate Sec. 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law?","No, because good time credits were an act of grace that could be taken away at any time.","Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.","Yes, because the legislature does not have the authority to pass a law that decreases good time credits for prisoners.","No, the criminal defendant did not have a vested right in the early release date.",B
"A state's constitution reserves to the people of each municipality in the state the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation. A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a convalescent home on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the real estate developer's subsequent application for approval for a proposed home on the grounds was rejected because the rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. In an action brought in state court seeking a judgment declaring the city charter amendment invalid, the court will most likely declare the amendment","unconstitutional, as violation of the real estate developer's due process rights.","unconstitutional, as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to a regulatory body.","constitutional, as a valid exercise of the city's police power.","constitutional, as a valid exercise of a power reserved by the people to themselves.",D

"A person owned property next to a highway. After raking leaves on his property into a large pile, the landowner loaded the leaves into several large metal barrels so that he could burn the leaves. Before starting the fire, the landowner telephoned the local weather bureau to determine which direction the wind would be blowing. Because a highway was located on the southern edge of his property, he was aware that it would be unsafe to burn the leaves if the wind was blowing in that direction. The weather bureau, however, indicated that the wind would be gusting in a northerly direction. Shortly after the landowner set the leaves on fire, the wind current unexpectedly shifted and started gusting in a southerly direction. As a consequence, the smoke and ashes blew over the highway, resulting in poor visibility. Moments later, a motorist was driving his automobile on the highway in a westerly direction.

"An investor owned a four-story office building located in downtown. The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt.

Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be",that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.,that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.,that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.,that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.,D
"A pharmaceutical company manufactured a new contraceptive sponge. The pharmaceutical company initially intended for the contraceptive to be available for purchase without a doctor's prescription. However, a study by the Food and Drug Administration revealed that the contraceptive might prove harmful to some users with preexisting health problems. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the contraceptive across state lines to those who do not have a doctor's prescription. This law is probably","constitutional, because Congress has the power to provide for the general welfare.","constitutional, because Congresshas the power to regulate interstatecommerce.","unconstitutional, because it deprives the manufacturer a property right without just compensation.","unconstitutional, because it interferes with the right of privacy of contraceptive users.",B
"A teenager borrowed a car from his uncle. The uncle knew that the teenager was incapable of driving a car safely. The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?","Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.","Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.","No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.","No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.",D

He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her.

"On Friday night, a driver was injured in an automobile accident after his vehicle was sideswiped by an unidentified motorist. Following the accident, the driver was admitted to the hospital where he was treated for his injuries. While at the hospital, the driver was diagnosed with a broken back. He was put in a body cast and then placed in traction. The driver's physician assembled the traction apparatus and positioned the driver's left leg in an overhead stirrup at a 40-degree angle. The driver was instructed to lie on his back on the bed. On Saturday morning after breakfast, the driver requested a bedpan from a nurse. She was placing the bedpan under the driver's body when the stirrup, which was holding his leg, broke. This caused the driver's leg to fall against the metal framing along the side of the bed, fracturing his tibia.

Although the hospital charged the woman a substantial fee for the doctor's services, the bill did not include a separate charge for the cost of the bone screws. A few months after the surgery, the woman's leg still was not fully healed. The doctor eventually concluded that the screws that were inserted into the woman's leg had been defective.

A group of adjoining landowners who owned single-family residences sued for an injunction, alleging various environmental violations.

This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?","Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.","Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval  the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.","Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.","No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.",D

"A write-in candidate is a Mexican-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Mexican voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native Mexican people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution.

"A landowner, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding ""upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,"" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon.

"A federal statute makes it a crime for anyone to ""knowingly"" use, transfer, acquire, alter, or possess food stamps in any manner not authorized by statute or federal regulations. A restaurant owner purchased food stamps from an undercover federal agent several times for a price below face value. At trial, the judge refused to charge the jury that this was a specific intent crime requiring proof that the defendant knew that he was acting illegally. The government urged that no mens rea, or ""evil-meaning mind"" had to be proved. The court simply told the jury that ""knowingly"" means that the Defendant realized what he was doing, and did not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident. The owner was convicted and appealed. What will the federal appellate court likely decide regarding the lower court's interpretation of the criminal intent required under the statute?","Some statutes are written without the need to prove any particular mens rea, and this statute appears to be one of them, making the court's instructions appropriate.","Where all that is available regarding intent is the use of the word ""knowingly"", the prosecution must at least prove that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations.",This is a strict liability crime that requires no proof of criminal knowledge or specific criminal intent.,The prosecution must prove that the defendant had specific knowledge of the precise provisions of the federal food stamp law and the specific actions that were prohibited.,B

She signed a simple consent form allowing an appendectomy to be performed, and giving the surgeon the right to respond to any life-threatening conditions that required immediate surgical intervention . During surgery, the surgeon performed a full hysterectomy because he felt that it would be a sound medical procedure under the circumstances, even though no emergency existed.

"A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?",It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.,It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.,It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.,It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.,B

"A manufacturer of appliances put a washing machine of a new and advanced design on the market. Two years of experimental use prior to commercial marketing had demonstrated that the machine laundered clothes more cleanly, more rapidly, and at a lower cost than any previous model. After nine months of commercial sales on a nationwide basis, the manufacturer discovered that an electrical unit in the machine tended to overheat greatly when the machine was heavily loaded or used continuously for more than one hour. The manufacturer promptly notified all dealers that it was recalling machines still in dealers' stock for corrective adjustment.
